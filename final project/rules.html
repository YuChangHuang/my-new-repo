                <ol>
                    <li>Always use the bike lane when one is available. (Usually bike lanes are maroon)</li>
                    <li>Stay on the right side of the bike lane and overtake other cyclists from the left. If there is a two-way bike lane, you donâ€™t have to go to the right side of the road, but if the two-way bike lane ends and becomes a one-way bike lane, you must follow the rules and go to the right side.</li>
                    <li>If you are overtaking someone, ring your bell to let them know you are passing.</li>
                    <li>You are allowed to ride side-by-side with one other cyclist, but no more than two.</li>
                    <li>While there are traffic lights specifically for cyclists, you must stop at every red light.</li>
                    <li>Cycling on sidewalks is not allowed.</li>
                    <li>In addition to the official cycling rules, there are many things to keep in mind while riding. By following Dutch cycling etiquette, you can avoid unnecessary trouble for yourself and others.</li>

                    <li>Emergency vehicles with flashing lights and sirens (such as police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances) always have the right of way.</li>
